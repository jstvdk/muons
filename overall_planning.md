### So we have muons, and they 

- #### they born and flying through the atmosphere:####
   - they have pure physics characteristic (mass,energy,direction?, flux/rate, speed, cherenkov angle, production height, attenuation length, energy loss, time of arrival, etc)
   - geometrical things - shape and size of the cherenkov cone, that would be good to know, timespan of the sygnal for different muon initial params
   - they interact with :
      - magnetic field (bending trajectory)
      - other particles
      - light which they produce undergo extinction (by molecules and aerosol) and scattering?
      - optical abberation (but probably that depends on the camera and should be move later)
     
- #### now when muon reached our detector:
   -  it can be three types - local event non-local event, which has distinctive characteristic,
  and maybe it would be good to find some dependecy of them.
   - When muon crossing the shadowing mast of telescopes, it can lose big part of the information - this should be handled.
   - But, we have new problem here - 4 types of camera:
      
      - LST, NectarCam, FlashCam, Astri - which means for each of them should be different approach. Up to now I think we can manage it with different config files for eafch of them.
         - Interesting idea here is to perform corss checks betweem=n camera and how they process muins
            - THAT SHOULD BEVERY IMPORTQNT TASK
